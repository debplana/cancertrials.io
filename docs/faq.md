# Frequently Asked Questions

## Data imputation 
### Q: What is individual participant data (IPD)?

A: IPD are the timing of events for individual patients enrolled in a clinical trial. Event types most often include censoring or death for cancer clinical trials, but can also include surrogate events such as disease progression, biochemical or clinical treatment failure, and local-regional recurrence of disease. 

## Analysis
### Q: Is this study a meta-analysis? 
A: No; meta-analysis is a type of formal study design to systematically integrate the results of previous research studies to make conclusions relevant to that disease and treatment area, such as to provide a pooled estimate of a treatmentâ€™s effect.  Our work aims instead to analyze cancer survival data broadly across many kinds of cancer and treatment modalities, without aiming to make any conclusions directly related to treatment practice.
