### Q: What is individual participant data (IPD)?

A: IPD are the timing of events for individual patients enrolled in a clinical trial. Event types most often include censoring or death for cancer clinical trials, but can also include surrogate events such as: progression as defined by radiological tumor growth, biochemical or clinical treatment failure, and local-regional recurrence of disease.
