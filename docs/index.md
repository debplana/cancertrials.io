# cancertrials.io

Welcome to cancertrials.io!
The site is designed by the following groups to help researchers access and analyze imputed individual participant data (IPD) from phase III oncology clinical trials: 

* [Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School](https://hits.harvard.edu/the-program/laboratory-of-systems-pharmacology/about/)
* [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/)
* [Palmer Laboratory at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.med.unc.edu/pharm/directory/adam-palmer-phd/)

The current data set consists of imputed IPD from ~150 trial publications in breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer, which in aggregate comprise ~220,000 overall survival or event-free survival events (e.g. progression free survival, PFS). To learn more about the data and analysis, please see our preprint:
["Cancer patient survival can be accurately parameterized, revealing time-dependent therapeutic effects and doubling the precision of small trials" by 
Deborah Plana, Geoffrey Fell, Brian M. Alexander, Adam C. Palmer, Peter K. Sorger. 
bioRxiv 2021.05.14.442837; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.14.442837](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.14.442837v1)


The imputed IPD and analysis are available through an interactive R Shiny application (see "Access data"). 

The site is currently under construction and will be expanded to include additional cancer types and treatment modalities. 

If you have questions or would like to contribte data to this effort, please reach out to CancerIPD [at] gmail.com.
