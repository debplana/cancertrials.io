# cancertrials.io

##Welcome to cancertrials.io!
The site is designed by the following groups to help researchers access and analyze imputed individual participant data (IPD) from phase III oncology clinical trials. 

* [Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School](https://hits.harvard.edu/the-program/laboratory-of-systems-pharmacology/about/)
* [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/)
* [Palmer Laboratory at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.med.unc.edu/pharm/directory/adam-palmer-phd/)

The current data set consists of imputed IPD from ~150 trial publications in breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. The site is currently under construction and will be expanded to include additional cancer types and treatment modalities. 

If you have questions or would like to contribte data to this effort, please reach out to CancerIPD [at] gmail.com.
